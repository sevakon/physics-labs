Fourth-semester Physics Lab Assignments at ITMO University

By some weird twist of faith, I am studying Physics at ITMO University. Here is the collection of laboratory assignments for the **Optics** module. Although I love Physics with all my heart, these lab assignments drive me nuts because of their stupidness. I put all of them publicly available for the use of next years' students if anyone, just like me, struggles to find the motivation to do these silly, non-sense tasks. **Please mind that I do not guarantee the correctness of the assignments.**

All of the assignments are done using Jupyter Notebook and Python scientific packages like NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib, etc. **I highly recommend getting familiar with these kinds of technology!**
