# Physics Lab 
Fourth-semester Physics Lab Assignments :pill: at ITMO University :school:

By some weird twist of faith, I am studying Physics at ITMO University. Here is the collection of laboratory assignments for the **Optics** module :eyeglasses:. Although I love Physics with all my heart :heart:, these lab assignments drive me nuts because of their ... stupidness :angry:. I put all of them publicly available for the use of next years' students if anyone, just like me, struggles to find the motivation to do these silly, non-sense, :poop: tasks. :exclamation: **Please mind that I do not guarantee the correctness of the assignments.** :exclamation:

All of the assignments are done using Jupyter Notebook :orange_book: and Python :snake: scientific packages like NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib, etc. **I highly recommend getting familiar with these kinds of technology!**    

Please star :star2: the repository if this was helpful to you. PRs are welcome!
